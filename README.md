# Introducing Strongback

Strongback is a simple open source software library that makes your robot code stronger. You can use it along with the WPILib library on your FIRST Robotics Competition robot's RoboRIO. Strongback's design simplifies your robot code, makes it easier for you to test your code without robot hardware, and can record real-time data while you operate your robot for later post-processing.

* *Testable* - Make your robot code much more unit testable. Run the tests on your development machines without requiring any real robot hardware.
* *Hardware abstractions* - Useful abstractions for common actuators and sensors. Easily use different implementations for hardware and for testing.
* *Command framework* - An improved, simplified, and testable command framework. Works automatically with data recorder.
* *Data recorder* - Record in real time the input and output signals from the RoboRIO, button presses, changes in command state, and other information. Process the data in real time (while you drive your robot) or afterward.
* *Use with WPILib* - Built on top of WPILib, so it's familiar. 

We're just getting started, so stay tuned.
